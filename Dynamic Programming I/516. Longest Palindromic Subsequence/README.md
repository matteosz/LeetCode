# Longest Palindromic Subsequence

Given a string s, find the longest palindromic subsequence's length in s.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

### Example 1:
```ruby
Input: s = "bbbab"
Output: 4
Explanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb".
```
### Example 2:
```ruby
Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: 2
Explanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bb".
```
### Constraints:

- 1 <= s.length <= 1000
- s consist of only digits and English letters.
